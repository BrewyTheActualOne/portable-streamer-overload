### Some Legal Facts So I don't get sued (I guess)
I'm not trying to condone privacy in not a single way. this project is just for experimental purposes and some additional fame because i should get known if i do this, no? 
Needy Streamer Overload, Needdy Girl Overdose, Kawaii Angel, ame-chan and all ripped resources Are both owned by whysoserious,inc.

i higly doubt it will take a whole decade to port this game...
